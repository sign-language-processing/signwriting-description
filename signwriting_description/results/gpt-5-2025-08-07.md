| ![FSW: M546x518S30007482x483S22f07525x467S15a2f516x482](assets/examples/hello.png) | Hello | With your non-dominant open hand, fingers together and palm away from your body, hold it near the right side of your forehead (at the upper rim of your face). Move the hand twice in short straight motions diagonally up and to your right in the wall plane. |
| ![FSW: M531x539S2ff00482x482S26500517x507S33e00482x482S15a00494x512](assets/examples/thank-you.png) | Thank You | With your dominant open hand flat, palm toward your body, hold it just below your chin. Move the hand slightly to your right in a small straight path, keeping it at the same distance from your body. Smile. |
| ![FSW: M517x527S15a37494x496S20500483x516S1f702490x490S22a00493x473](assets/examples/help.png) | Help (him/her) | With your dominant open hand, palm toward the ceiling, make a single light touch in front of you. Then quickly form a fist with the thumb along the index-finger side, palm toward your body, and lift the hand upward a small distance. |
| ![FSW: M516x513S13f10487x498S22114484x487](assets/examples/no-hand.png) | No | With your dominant hand, extend your index and middle fingers together with the thumb extended, other fingers closed. Hold the hand in front of your torso with the palm toward your left. Hinge at the wrist to move the hand up and down in a large motion. |
| ![FSW: M518x524S30122482x476S30c00482x489](assets/examples/no-face.png) | No | Move your head side to side in a straight horizontal path. Lower your eyebrows as you do it. |
| ![FSW: M511x520S1f701490x481S21100495x506](assets/examples/sorry.png) | Sorry | With your dominant thumb-up fist, palm toward your body and slightly angled, hold it in front of your torso. Rub in a small circular motion in place a few times. |
| ![FSW: M535x542S1060a477x458S10621494x458S20800495x472S10629468x517S10602494x517S20800489x532S2d205502x485S2d211465x484](assets/examples/friend.png) | Friend | With both hands in a hooked index-finger handshape (index bent, other fingers closed), hold them in front of your torso with the palms facing each other—your non-dominant palm toward your body and your dominant palm away. Make a quick grasping motion with both hands. Then rotate both hands once in the floor plane as you lower them slightly so the palms swap—dominant palm toward your body, non-dominant palm away—and make the same quick grasping motion again. |

Bring each fist to touch the opposite upper arm near the shoulder, giving light taps on both sides. |
| ![FSW: M522x525S11541498x491S11549479x498S20600489x476](assets/examples/name.png) | Name | With both hands, extend your index and middle fingers together while keeping the other fingers closed. Hold them in front of your chest with your dominant palm toward your left and your non-dominant palm toward your right, fingertips pointing up and angled toward each other; tap the paired fingertips together lightly a couple of times. |
