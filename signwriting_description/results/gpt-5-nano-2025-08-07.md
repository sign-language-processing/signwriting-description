| ![FSW: M546x518S30007482x483S22f07525x467S15a2f516x482](assets/examples/hello.png) | Hello | At the top-right of the head, the signer uses a flat non-dominant hand with the palm facing outward and rotated 45 degrees counter-clockwise, held near the head, while the dominant hand makes two straight, wall-plane movements rotated 45 degrees clockwise, sweeping along the upper-right area of the head. |

| ![FSW: M526x532S15a37484x501S20500473x521S1f702480x495S26627504x468](assets/examples/help.png) | Help (him/her) | Begin with your dominant hand in a flat position, palm upward and rotated 45 degrees clockwise. Make a few light touches with that hand. Then form a fist with the dominant hand, the thumb held to the side and the palm facing inward, rotated 90 degrees counterclockwise. Finally, perform a medium-length straight movement along the floor plane, guiding the hand in a path that is about 45 degrees clockwise. |
| ![FSW: M516x513S13f10487x498S22114484x487](assets/examples/no-hand.png) | No | With your dominant hand, form a small three-finger angled fist (index and middle fingers extended, thumb angled) and keep the palm facing sideways near chest level. The non-dominant hand is rotated 180 degrees clockwise and performs a large up-and-down hinge movement, swinging up and down in a clear vertical arc. |
| ![FSW: M518x524S30122482x476S30c00482x489](assets/examples/no-face.png) | No | The signer moves the head straight along the wall plane, keeping the head level and facing forward, while the eyebrows are drawn straight down in a stern, attentive expression; the rest of the face remains neutral and the shoulders stay relaxed. |
| ![FSW: M511x520S1f701490x481S21100495x506](assets/examples/sorry.png) | Sorry | With your dominant hand in a fist, the thumb tucked to the side and the fist angled diagonally inward (thumb-side diagonal) with the palm facing inward, perform a few small rubbing motions in place. |
| ![FSW: M535x542S1060a477x458S10621494x458S20800495x472S10629468x517S10602494x517S20800489x532S2d205502x485S2d211465x484](assets/examples/friend.png) | Friend | Both hands begin with bent index fingers forming small fists near the torso, the non-dominant fist inward-facing with the wrist rotated 90 degrees clockwise and the dominant fist outward-facing with the wrist rotated 45 degrees counter-clockwise. A pair of light grasps are then shown on each hand at two different heights, first higher and then lower. Finally, both hands perform floor-plane rotations as they strike the floor: the dominant hand twists about 135 degrees clockwise while the non-dominant hand twists about 45 degrees counter-clockwise, delivering a quick, downward hit. |

They are used to make a pair of light, brief touches to two nearby spots in front of the torso—first at one side, then at the other—while the arms extend forward to a short reach. |
| ![FSW: M522x525S11541498x491S11549479x498S20600489x476](assets/examples/name.png) | Name | Both hands form a joined index-and-middle-finger unit, with the dominant hand rotated about 45 degrees counterclockwise and the non-dominant hand rotated about 45 degrees clockwise, and the palms facing sideways. Move the two joined finger units to touch several different points in front of you, as if tapping a few spots in the air. |
