| ![FSW: M546x518S30007482x483S22f07525x467S15a2f516x482](assets/examples/hello.png) | Hello | Trace a rim around the top-right area of the head: the dominant hand performs two quick straight movements in the wall plane, with the hand rotated about 45 degrees clockwise. Meanwhile, the non-dominant hand remains flat, palm facing outward, rotated about 45 degrees counter-clockwise, held near the head. The overall motion suggests circling or framing the head. |
| ![FSW: M531x539S2ff00482x482S26500517x507S33e00482x482S15a00494x512](assets/examples/thank-you.png) | Thank You | Your head tilts/moves slightly, with a warm smile on your face. At the same time, your dominant hand stays flat with the palm facing inward and makes a small, straight sliding movement along the floor plane in front of you. |
| ![FSW: M526x532S15a37484x501S20500473x521S1f702480x495S26627504x468](assets/examples/help.png) | Help (him/her) | Start with your dominant hand in a flat, palm-up position, rotated about 45 degrees clockwise and held parallel to the floor. Then perform a light single touch (Touch Single) with that hand. Next, switch to a fist with the thumb at the side, palm facing inward, and rotated 90 degrees counter-clockwise. Finally, execute a medium-length straight movement along the floor plane, following a diagonal path about 45 degrees clockwise (up-right) from the hand's position. There are no facial expressions indicated. |
| ![FSW: M516x513S13f10487x498S22114484x487](assets/examples/no-hand.png) | No | The dominant hand is in a fist with the index and middle fingers angled (thumb angled), palm facing sideways. The non-dominant hand is rotated upside down (180 degrees clockwise) and performs a large up-and-down hinge motion. |
| ![FSW: M518x524S30122482x476S30c00482x489](assets/examples/no-face.png) | No | Move your head straight along the wall plane (a direct, level head movement). Your eyebrows are straight down, giving a neutral/serious facial expression. The rest of the body stays still. |
| ![FSW: M511x520S1f701490x481S21100495x506](assets/examples/sorry.png) | Sorry | With your dominant hand in a fist and the thumb along the side (thumb-side diagonal), rotate the fist about 45 degrees counter-clockwise so the hand points inward. Then perform a light single rubbing motion (a few repetitions) at the indicated area. |
| ![FSW: M535x542S1060a477x458S10621494x458S20800495x472S10629468x517S10602494x517S20800489x532S2d205502x485S2d211465x484](assets/examples/friend.png) | Friend | Two fists with the index fingers bent are held near the chest. The non-dominant fist faces inward, rotated about 90 degrees clockwise; the dominant fist faces outward, rotated about 45 degrees counter-clockwise. There are small grasp actions (grasp single) with each hand. Then both hands perform a floor-plane rotation and hit the floor: the dominant hand twists roughly 135 degrees clockwise as it hits, and the non-dominant hand twists about 45 degrees counter-clockwise as it hits. Overall, it reads as a paired, rhythmic floor-stamping motion near the torso. |
| ![FSW: M530x518S20500470x500S20305503x482S3770b488x496S37713487x496S20500520x499S20303474x483](assets/examples/love.png) | Love | Two fists meet in front of the chest, rotated inward (dominant fist about 135° clockwise, non-dominant about 135° counter-clockwise). They perform two light single touches together at chest level, with arms held close to the body and elbows slightly bent. There’s no distinct facial expression shown. |
| ![FSW: M522x525S11541498x491S11549479x498S20600489x476](assets/examples/name.png) | Name | Both hands form a conjoined index-middle unit (index and middle fingers touching) in fists, with palms facing sideways. The dominant hand is rotated 45 degrees counter-clockwise and the non-dominant hand 45 degrees clockwise. The sign involves a few quick touches to multiple spots (Touch Multiple) with these fingers. |
