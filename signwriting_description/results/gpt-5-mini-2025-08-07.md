| ![FSW: M546x518S30007482x483S22f07525x467S15a2f516x482](assets/examples/hello.png) | Hello | Hold your non‑dominant flat hand at the top‑right side of your head (palm facing outward). With your dominant flat hand (rotated slightly), make two short straight movements in the wall plane away from that spot — a quick double stroke as if brushing or indicating the side of your head. |
| ![FSW: M531x539S2ff00482x482S26500517x507S33e00482x482S15a00494x512](assets/examples/thank-you.png) | Thank You | Smile. With your dominant hand flat (palm facing you), hold it just below the chin/chest and make a small straight upward movement toward the face. Keep your head steady and relaxed while you perform the brief upward motion. |
| ![FSW: M526x532S15a37484x501S20500473x521S1f702480x495S26627504x468](assets/examples/help.png) | Help (him/her) | Start with your dominant hand in a thumb-side diagonal fist near your body. Tap or touch briefly, then open the same hand into a flat palm facing up. Move that flat palm outward and upward in a single straight motion toward the up-right diagonal. No specific facial expression or body movement indicated. |
| ![FSW: M516x513S13f10487x498S22114484x487](assets/examples/no-hand.png) | No | Hold your dominant hand with the index and middle fingers together and the thumb angled (palm sideways). Position it near your non‑dominant hand, then hinge the non‑dominant hand up and down in a large wrist/forearm motion while the dominant hand stays as the reference point. Keep a neutral facial expression. |
| ![FSW: M518x524S30122482x476S30c00482x489](assets/examples/no-face.png) | No | Turn your head slightly to the right in a small, straight movement (across the wall plane) while your eyebrows pull straight down into a frown. Maintain a neutral body posture and let your gaze follow the head movement. |
| ![FSW: M511x520S1f701490x481S21100495x506](assets/examples/sorry.png) | Sorry | Hold your dominant hand in a thumb‑side diagonal fist (thumb along the side, palm facing inward, rotated about 45°) and make a few small in‑place rubbing motions with that hand. No facial or body movement specified. |
| ![FSW: M535x542S1060a477x458S10621494x458S20800495x472S10629468x517S10602494x517S20800489x532S2d205502x485S2d211465x484](assets/examples/friend.png) | Friend | Hold both hands in front of you at about chest height with the index fingers bent (hook shape), palms facing each other but slightly rotated. Start with the dominant hand: reach forward with a short grasping motion, then rotate the hand down to make a light tap. Repeat the same with the non‑dominant hand, alternating the short grasp+rotate+tap motions a few times. Keep your face neutral. |
| ![FSW: M530x518S20500470x500S20305503x482S3770b488x496S37713487x496S20500520x499S20303474x483](assets/examples/love.png) | Love | Both hands form fists, held in front of the torso with the palms facing inward and the knuckles angled toward each other. Bring the fists together and tap them against each other a few short, repeated times (small, brief motions). Keep the shoulders and face relaxed/neutral. |
| ![FSW: M522x525S11541498x491S11549479x498S20600489x476](assets/examples/name.png) | Name | Hold both hands in front of you in neutral space with the index and middle fingers together on each hand (like a two-finger unit). Palms face each other at a slight angle. Bring the finger tips together and tap them repeatedly (a few small, quick touches). No facial expression or head movement is indicated. |
