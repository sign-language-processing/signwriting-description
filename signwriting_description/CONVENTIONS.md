# Sign Description Conventions (SignWriting-Aligned)

This document defines conventions for writing natural-language sign descriptions alongside SignWriting.

Descriptions are signer-facing, instructional, and optimized for:

* low ambiguity
* SignWriting alignment
* consistent terminology
* scalable precision
* ML + teaching usability

Structure is guided but not rigid. Natural instructional prose is preferred over templates.

These conventions follow the **Expressive Viewpoint** and palm-orientation principles used in SignWriting pedagogy.

---

# 1. Viewpoint — Always Signer Perspective

All descriptions use the **signer’s viewpoint** (expressive viewpoint).

Write directions relative to the signer’s own body.

**Use**

* your dominant hand / your non-dominant hand
* your right / your left
* toward your body
* away from your body
* to your left / right

**Avoid**

* viewer-relative wording
* left side of the image
* toward the camera
* screen-left / screen-right

---

# 2. Voice & Style — Instructional but Natural

Prefer direct instructional phrasing.

Common verb openings:

* With your …
* Place your …
* Touch your …
* Hold your …
* Move your …
* Bring your …
* Rub / Tap / Slide / Press …

Do not force a template if it hurts readability.

---

# 3. Feature Order — Recommended Description Order

When high precision is needed, describe in this order:

1. Handedness / roles
2. Handshape
3. Palm orientation
4. Finger direction (if useful)
5. Location
6. Contact geometry
7. Movement path
8. Manner
9. Repetition
10. Non-manuals

Example:

> With your dominant fist, palm toward your body, place it on your chest. Rub in a small clockwise circle repeatedly.

---

# 4. Hand Roles — Always Label When Asymmetric

When hands differ, label explicitly.

**Use**

* dominant hand
* non-dominant hand
* both hands (only if symmetric)

Do not assume symmetry.

---

# 5. Handshape — Be Explicit When Contrastive

Name the handshape in plain language when it matters:

* open hand
* fist
* index finger extended
* index and middle fingers extended
* curved hand
* thumb up fist

Avoid symbolic labels (H-hand, V-hand, etc.) in README-level prose unless the audience is specialized.

---

# 6. Palm Orientation — Body-Anchored Only

Describe palm orientation relative to the signer’s body.

**Use**

* palm toward your body
* palm away from your body
* palm toward your left / right
* palm toward the ceiling
* palm toward the floor

**Avoid**

* inward / outward (unanchored)
* vertical / horizontal palm
* sideways (alone)

If needed, anchor:

* palm angled away from your body ✅
* palm outward ❌

---

# 7. Finger Direction — Add Only When Helpful

Use when it disambiguates plane/orientation.

**Use**

* fingers pointing up / down
* fingers pointing forward
* fingers pointing toward your body
* fingers pointing to your left / right

Skip if redundant.

---

# 8. Location — Use Body Anchors

Prefer concrete body anchors:

* at your forehead
* near the right side of your forehead
* on your chest
* in front of your torso
* near your lips

Avoid abstract space if a body anchor exists.

---

# 9. Contact Geometry — Specify Surface-to-Surface

When hands touch, specify **which side/surface** contacts which.

This is critical for disambiguating signs like NAME.

**Surface terms**

* fingertips
* finger pads
* thumb tip
* palm
* back of the hand
* index-finger side
* middle-finger side
* little-finger side

**Examples**

* touch your fingertips to your lips
* place the middle-finger side of your dominant hand against the index-finger side of your non-dominant hand
* tap the fingertips together
* rest the fist on your chest

Do not default to “tap” without surface detail when side vs top matters.

---

# 10. Movement — Use Physical Verbs

Prefer concrete motion verbs over abstract ones.

**Preferred**

* move
* bring
* lift
* lower
* slide
* rub
* tap
* press
* brush
* cross
* hook
* rotate
* twist

**Avoid**

* indicate
* gesture
* align
* approach

---

# 11. Path — Use Signer-Relative Directions

Movement directions are signer-relative.

**Use**

* forward (away from your body)
* toward your body
* upward / downward
* to your left / right
* in a straight path
* in an arc
* in a circle

Avoid viewer-relative directions.

---

# 12. Manner — Encode Motion Quality When Relevant

Add manner when it distinguishes signs.

**Examples**

* quickly
* slowly
* firmly
* lightly
* with small movements
* with a deliberate movement

---

# 13. Repetition — Mark Only When Non-Default

Single movement is the default — **do not mark it**.

Mark repetition only when present.

**Use**

* twice
* three times
* repeatedly
* alternating
* with repeated small movements

Do not write “once”.

---

# 14. Circular Motion — Prefer Contact Verbs When True

If there is sustained contact, prefer:

* rub in a small circle
* slide in a circle

Instead of:

* move in a circle

This encodes both **path + contact**.

---

# 15. Non-Manual Signals — Separate Clause

Describe non-manuals separately.

**Examples**

* Shake your head left and right.
* Lower your eyebrows.
* Puff your cheeks.

Do not merge with hand motion unless tightly coupled.

---

# 16. Precision Scaling

Choose detail level based on ambiguity risk.

**Minimal**

> Touch your lips, then move your hand forward.

**Teaching**

> With your dominant open hand, touch your lips, palm toward your body. Move your hand forward.

**High Precision**

> With your dominant open hand, fingers together and pointing up, palm toward your body, place your fingertips on your lips. Move your hand forward in a straight path.

---

# 17. Consistency Over Exhaustiveness

Prefer:

* consistent wording
* body-anchored orientation
* explicit contact geometry
* concrete verbs

Do not over-specify unless needed to prevent confusion.

Consistency across entries beats maximal detail per entry.

---

# 18. Canonical handshape form

Here are the ASL Fingerspelling Handshape Descriptions, which may help describe signs more consistently.

**A** — Form a fist with all fingers closed and together. Place your thumb along the side of the index finger.
**B** — Extend all four fingers straight upward and together. Fold your thumb across the palm.
**C** — Curve all fingers and the thumb forward to form a “C”-shaped open curve, with the thumb opposite the fingers.
**D** — Extend your index finger upward. Touch the tip of your thumb to the tips of your middle, ring, and little fingers.
**E** — Curl all four fingers downward so their fingertips press against the thumb tip, forming a compact closed shape.
**F** — Touch the tip of your thumb to the tip of your index finger to form a small circle. Extend your middle, ring, and little fingers upward.
**G** — Extend your index finger forward horizontally. Extend your thumb forward parallel to the index finger. Keep the other fingers closed.
**H** — Extend your index and middle fingers forward horizontally and together. Keep the ring and little fingers closed. Place the thumb alongside the closed fingers.
**I** — Extend only your little finger upward. Keep the other fingers closed with the thumb resting against them.
**J** — Form the I handshape (little finger extended). Trace a J-shaped curve in the air with the little finger.
**K** — Extend your index and middle fingers upward and spread apart. Place your thumb against the middle finger between its base and middle joint. Keep the ring and little fingers closed.
**L** — Extend your index finger upward and your thumb outward to the side, forming a right angle. Keep the other fingers closed.
**M** — Form a fist and place your thumb across the palm under the index, middle, and ring fingers, so the three fingers rest over the thumb.
**N** — Form a fist and place your thumb across the palm under the index and middle fingers only, with those two fingers resting over the thumb.
**O** — Curve all fingers and the thumb inward so their tips meet, forming a round closed circle.
**P** — Form the K handshape, then rotate the hand so the index and middle fingers point downward and the thumb still contacts the middle finger.
**Q** — Form the G handshape, then rotate the hand so the index finger and thumb point downward.
**R** — Extend your index and middle fingers upward and cross the middle finger over the index finger. Keep the other fingers closed.
**S** — Form a fist with all fingers closed and together. Place your thumb across the front of the fingers.
**T** — Form a fist with your thumb placed between the index and middle fingers.
**U** — Extend your index and middle fingers upward and together. Keep the ring and little fingers closed, with the thumb resting against them.
**V** — Extend your index and middle fingers upward and spread apart. Keep the ring and little fingers closed, with the thumb resting against them.
**W** — Extend your index, middle, and ring fingers upward and spread apart. Keep the little finger closed, with the thumb resting against it.
**X** — Form a fist and extend your index finger upward in a curved hook shape. Keep the thumb against the closed fingers.
**Y** — Extend your thumb and little finger outward to opposite sides. Keep the index, middle, and ring fingers closed.
**Z** — Extend your index finger forward horizontally. Draw a Z shape in the air with the fingertip.
**0** — Curve all fingers and the thumb inward so their tips meet, forming a closed round circle.
**1** — Extend your index finger upward. Keep the other fingers closed, with the thumb resting against them.
**2** — Extend your index and middle fingers upward and spread apart. Keep the ring and little fingers closed, with the thumb resting against them.
**3** — Extend your thumb, index, and middle fingers upward and spread apart. Keep the ring and little fingers closed.
**4** — Extend your index, middle, ring, and little fingers upward and spread apart. Fold your thumb across the palm.
**5** — Extend all five fingers upward and spread apart.
**6** — Touch the tip of your thumb to the tip of your little finger. Extend your index, middle, and ring fingers upward.
**7** — Touch the tip of your thumb to the tip of your ring finger. Extend your index, middle, and little fingers upward.
**8** — Touch the tip of your thumb to the tip of your middle finger. Extend your index, ring, and little fingers upward.
**9** — Touch the tip of your thumb to the tip of your index finger, forming a small circle. Extend your middle, ring, and little fingers upward.
